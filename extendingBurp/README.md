# Extending Burpsuite
In order to extend burpsuite you'll have to use Jython, which is a Java implementation of Python. More info is available at the website https://www.jython.org/index but I've included the package in this folder for easy access.

Once you have Jython you'll need to point Burpsuite at it, to do this open Burpsuite then go to the "Extender" tab, then the "Options" tab. Now select the "jython-standalone.jar" file and you're good to go.
